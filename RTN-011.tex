\setDocAbstract{%
Science during the first year of Rubin Observatory LSST operations is a high priority. 

Rubin Observatory science will be enabled by data products from prompt processing, and from a series approximately annual data releases. 
Prompt data products are produced nightly as a result of difference image analysis. 
LSST DR1 will be based on the first 6 months of data and is planned for release 12 months after the start of operations. 

{\it Early Science} is defined as any science enabled by the \vrolsst prior to the first data release, Data Release 1 (DR1).   
Prior to DR1, The only LSST Data Products that will exist prior to DR1 are 1) those produced by commissioning data and 2) 

Alerts are the only data
product that will be immediately available (within 60 seconds of image readout) and publicly
shareable (not subject to a proprietary period; LSE-163). The worldwide community is ? and
has been for a while ? actively preparing to process the LSST alert stream and use it to generate groundbreaking scientific results.


Expectations of early science have been built on the basis of substantial science verification and validation surveys, and data previews coming out of commissioning (PCW2019).

Expectations for early science have largely been high due to the extensive amount of on sky time planned in com- missioning and science verification (SV).


Science during the first year of Rubin Observatory / LSST operations is a high priority. 

Prior to \drone, scientific investigations may be undertaken with data processed in Alert Production and Solar System Processing as well as \dpvs of the commissioning data.
Alerts of transient, variable, and/or moving objects are the only data product that will be immediately available (within 60 seconds of image readout) and publicly shareable, i.e not subject to a proprietary period. 
Alert Production requires high-quality template images of the sky, and thus full volume and full fidelity alerts will not be available until after \drone.
However, \ro is planning a process of incremental template generation to maximize the time-domain and solar system science achievable in the first year of operations.
The worldwide community is actively preparing to process the LSST alert stream and use it to generate groundbreaking scientific results. 
This note describes the \ro plan for ensuring \es. 
It is a living document that will evolve over the course of the remainder of the construction project and up until \drone.
