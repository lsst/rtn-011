Outline the current schedule 



\subsection{Science-driven prioritization of sky templates}
By the end of the commissioning period, coadd templates for use in difference imaging will only be available for $\approx$ 10\% of the sky. 
This leaves open the question of how to  prioritize  sky areas and bandpasses to optimize the science harvest prior to \drone.

\subsection{Template generation during commissioning}


\subsection{Template verification in commissioning}

The LSST SRD places well-defined criteria on the quality of the difference image and the amount of noise that a template can contribute to a difference image.  These criteria result in a minimum of three images being needed to construct a template for use in year one.  Science collaborations The commissioning period provides an excellent opportunity to investigate how many visits in a given bad are sufficient to construct a template that is good enough.  Given the desire to maximize the science harvest prior to the \drone,  relaxing these criteria might be preferable.
