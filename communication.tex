\section{Community Engagement}

Rubin Observatory will work closely with the community on the detailed design of the \esp. 

\subsection{Survey Cadence Optimization Committee}
The \href{https://www.lsst.org/content/charge-survey-cadence-optimization-committee-scoc}{Survey Cadence Optimization Committee (SCOC)} is an advisory committee to the Rubin Observatory Operations Director consisting of 10 members from drawn almost entirely from the science community.
It began in 2020 and will be a standing committee throughout the life of Rubin Observatory operations. 

Early Science observations must align with main survey and ultimate long-term science goals; the SCOC will be involved in all aspects of development of the \esp. 
Specifically, the SCOC will make specific recommendations for Early Science observations, based on the plans for commissioning and the realized performance of the telescope and software. 


\subsection{Community Forum}

The Rubin Observatory Community Platform has a dedicated category for Early Science\footnote{ See \url{https://community.lsst.org/t/about-the-early-science-category/5775}}, where community members are encouraged to open discussions on the topic of early science. 

\subsection{Community Input}

A process will be put in place to formally solicit input from the community. 
Several science collaborations have already been pro-active in providing input on considerations for template generation in year one on both the community forum and as research notes
The considerations presented will be taken into account in designing the \esp.
