\section{Roadmap and Timeline} \label{sec:timeline}

Table~\ref{tab:ops-timeline} shows the Operations timeline and provides nominal date ranges for the various elements of the Early Science Program.
The date ranges are derived from the Rubin ``Celebratory Milestones'', which are  published monthly on the Rubin Project website\footnote{\url{ls.st/dates}}.
For completed milestones the delivered date is given.
Milestone dates are given as min -- max ranges to indicate the associated uncertainty.
Typically the near date corresponds to the current Project forecast, plus any additional operational uncertainty.
The late date corresponds approximately to the current Project late date plus any additional operational uncertainty.
The shaded region contains roughly 80\% of the probability, while the lefthand edge of the shaded range indicates the earliest date the milestone could be reached.
The darker regions give a very rough indication of the +/-1 sigma error bars.
Over the course of the commissioning period, we expect these data ranges to shrink as our understanding of the remaining schedule uncertainty improves.
However, there is still the possibility of the assumptions underlying these distributions being wrong; this is just our best estimate at the current time.

The next key milestones in the Early Science Program are the start of LSST alerts in late 2025, and the start of the LSST in early 2026. 
Table ~\ref{tab:ops-timeline} will continue to be refined and updated in future version of this document as the Early Science Program progresses.
