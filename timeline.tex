\section{Roadmap and Timeline} \label{sec:timeline}

Table~\ref{tab:ops-timeline} presents the Operations timeline, including nominal date ranges for the various elements of the Early Science Program. 
For completed milestones, the actual delivery dates are listed. 
Milestone dates are expressed as minimum–maximum ranges to reflect the associated uncertainty. 
The early date typically corresponds to the current  forecast, including any additional operational uncertainty, while the late date approximately reflects the current  late date plus any additional operational uncertainty. 
As the release date approaches, we expect these ranges to narrow as our understanding of the remaining uncertainties improves. 
Nevertheless, there remains the possibility that the assumptions underlying these estimates are incorrect; the dates presented therefore represent our best current assessment.

The next key milestones in the Early Science Program are the start of LSST alerts in early 2026, followed by the start of the LSST. 
Table ~\ref{tab:ops-timeline} will continue to be refined and updated in future version of this document as the Early Science Program progresses.
