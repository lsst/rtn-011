\section{Roadmap and Timeline} \label{sec:timeline}

% \TODO{Phil}{Replace with milestones figure from DPRPT. Explain uncertainty. What happens if commissioning gets squeezed? Ops does SV, as explained in intro.tex.}

The timeline shown in Table~\ref{tab:milestones} below provides a list of key dates related to the \es program.
It will be updated with more dates related to the development of the \esp as they are defined.
These dates are derived from the ``Celebratory Milestones'' list published at monthly intervals on the Rubin Project website;\footnote{\url{https://www.lsst.org/about/project-status}} shown here are the milestones as of October 2022, which use Project controls data from August 2022.
Milestone dates are given as min-max ranges to indicate their uncertainty.
Typically the near date corresponds to the current Project forecast, plus any additional operational uncertainty.
The late date corresponds (approximately) to the current Project ``late date'' plus any additional operational uncertainty: this late date cannot be surpassed without the Project rebaselining its schedule.

The late dates for the DP2 and DR1 data release milestones allow for the possibility that the Project completes within its late date, but reduces the amount of on-sky LSST Cam commissioning time in order to do so.
In this eventuality, the operations team would spend up to 3 months at the start of the full/survey operations phase doing any remaining Science Validation Survey observations, such that DP2 could be realized as planned.
The LSST survey will start shortly after the completion of the SV surveys.

An intermediate (typically mid-range) date is used by the Rubin Operations teams for planning purposes. These nominal dates are illustrated in the timeline chart in Figure~\ref{fig:timeline} below.
