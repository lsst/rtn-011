\section{Early Science Data Products} 
\label{sec:data}

The definitive source for all LSST data products is the Data Products Definition Document, \citep{LSE-163}.
Here we provide a summary of the dat products that are expected to be made available as part of the Early Science Program. 

\subsection{Prompt data products}

Prompt data products are described in detail in the Data Products Definition Document (\DPDD).
Alert packets are triggered by difference image source detections and transmitted to community alert brokers\footnote{See \url{https://www.lsst.org/scientists/alert-brokers} for the list of selected brokers.} and are publicly available. 
Similarly, daily Solar System Processing identifies new Solar System Objects from difference image sources and reports those publicly to the Minor Planet Center.

Catalog and image products, as well as services for running user-generated processing on the data, are available to Rubin Data Rights holders after 24 hours through the Rubin Science Platform (\S~\ref{ssec:dataaccess}).
\DIASource, \DIAObject, and \SSObject catalogs are queryable using VO interfaces to the Prompt Products Database.

\subsection{Data Release data products}
Static science datasets for Early Science will flow from the \svs in commissioning
Images and catalogs from the DRP of the commissioning data will be made available to data rights holders via the access mechanisms described in \ref{ssec:dataaccess}.
The Rubin data rights policy is described in  \cite{RDO-013}.


\subsection{Access to \es data products}\label{ssec:dataaccess}
Alerts will be accessible by the community via one of nine Rubin endorsed Community Brokers. 
The community will access the Rubin data products via the Rubin Science Platform, \citep{LSE-319}.
