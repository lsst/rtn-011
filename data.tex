\section{Early Science Data Products} 
\label{sec:data}

\subsection{Prompt data products}

Prompt data products are described in detail in the Data Products Definition Document (\DPDD).
Alert packets are triggered by difference image source detections and transmitted to community alert brokers\footnote{See \url{https://www.lsst.org/scientists/alert-brokers} for the list of selected brokers.} and are publicly available. 
Similarly, daily Solar System Processing identifies new Solar System Objects from difference image sources and reports those publicly to the Minor Planet Center.

Catalog and image products, as well as services for running user-generated processing on the data, are available to Rubin Data Rights holders after 24 hours through the Rubin Science Platform (\S \ref{ssec:dataaccess}).
\DIASource, \DIAObject, and \SSObject catalogs are queryable using VO interfaces to the Prompt Products Database.


\subsection{Data Release data products}
Images and catalogs from the DRP of the commissioning data will be made available to  data rights holders via the access mechanisms described in \ref{ssec:dataaccess}.

\subsection{Access to \es data products}\label{ssec:dataaccess}
Describe how the \es  data products will be accessed by the community. 
Describe the community brokers, the science platforms and how the \dpvs play a role in providing access to \es data products. 
Explain that the same data rights policy applies to \es data products. \cite{RDO-013}.
