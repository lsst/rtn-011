\section{Early Science Data Products} 
\label{sec:data}

The definitive source for all LSST data products is the Data Products Definition Document, \citep{LSE-163}.
Here we provide a summary of the dat products that are expected to be made available as part of the Early Science Program. 

\subsection{Prompt data products}
All Prompt data products are world public and include: 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\textbf Alerts:}  Alert packet containing: alertId, DIASource, DIAObject or SSObject,  previous 12 months of detections,  science/template/difference image cutouts. 
\item {\textbf Images:	} Single visit images, difference images, template
\item {\textbf Catalogs:} DIASource, DIAObject, SSObject, ForcedSource.

Alerts will be issued with a latency of 60s from image readout. 
The prompt products database, containing the prompt catalogs will be updated on a 24hr timescale. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Release data products}
Static science datasets for Early Science will flow from the science verification surveys in commissioning
Images and catalogs from the DRP of the commissioning data will be made available to data rights holders via the access mechanisms described in \ref{ssec:dataaccess}.
The Rubin data rights policy is described in  \cite{RDO-013}.


\subsection{Access to \es data products}\label{ssec:dataaccess}
Alerts will be accessible by the community via one of nine Rubin endorsed Community Brokers. 
The community will access the Rubin data products via the Rubin Science Platform, \citep{LSE-319}.
