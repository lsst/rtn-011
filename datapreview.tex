\section{Data Previews and Data Release 1} 
\label{sec:datapreview}

A series of three Data Previews (DP) and one Data Release (DR) are planned to support the community as they develop their LSST analysis software and workflows, and to enable high-impact science as soon as possible.
\begin{itemize}
\item Data Preview 0 (DP0): Based on simulated LSST-like data.
\item Data Preview 1 (DP1): Based on a subset of early science-grade commissioning data taken with either ComCam or LSSTCam.
\item Data Preview 2 (DP2): Based on a full reprocessing of all science-grade LSSTCam data taken during commissioning.
\item Data Release 1 (DR1): Based on the first six months of LSST data. 
\end{itemize}
Due to the relatively short time periods available for commissioning observations (\S~\ref{ssec:scenarios}), the Data Previews will necessarily be limited in their area and temporal coverage relative to a full Data Release. 

The data products that comprise the Data Previews and Data Releases are produced by the LSST Science Pipelines \citep{2019ASPC..523..521B,2018PASJ...70S...5B}.
For an introduction to the LSST data products, see \citet{RubinDataProductsAbridged} and for a detailed description, see the LSST \dpdd{},  \citedsp{LSE-163}.
Each Data Preview and LSST Data Release will be accompanied by its own release-specific DPDD\footnote{For an example data release DPDD, see the online DP0.2 documentation {\url{https://dp0-2.lsst.io/data-products-dp0-2/}}.}, giving e.g. the  database schema for the catalogs included in that dataset.
Table~\ref{tab:data-preview-summary} provides a summary of the expected early science data products available in DP0, DP1, DP2 and the LSST Data Release 1.
All LSST data products will be subject to the embargo periods described in  \citeds{DMTN-199}.

\subsection{Data Preview 0}
\label{sec:dp0}

Data Preview 0 (DP0) is the first of three Data Previews to be released during the period leading up to the start of Rubin Observatory Operations. 
Data Preview 0 contains three stages, all based on simulated LSST-like data products. 
The goals of DP0 are to serve as an early integration test of the LSST Science Pipelines and the Rubin Science Platform (RSP), and to enable a limited number of astronomers and students to begin early preparations for science with the LSST.

The following sections outline which data products can be expected in each Data Preview and Data Release, and on what time scale.
See Table~\ref{tab:milestones} in the Timeline section below for a combined view of the expected data preview schedule and its uncertainties.

\subsubsection{Data Preview 0.1}
\label{sec:dp01}

Data Preview 0.1 (DP0.1) was released to a group, approximately 300,  of early adopters from the community in June 2021. 
It is based on the the simulated, LSST-like images generated by the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) for their Data Challenge 2 (DC2), \citep{2021ApJS..253...31L}. 
DP0.1 only uses the 300~\sqdeg of DC2 images that were simulated for five years of the LSST’s wide-fast-deep component (WFD) using a baseline cadence, \citedsp{PSTN-055}.
The DESC processed the simulated DC2 images with \href{https://pipelines.lsst.io/v/v19_0_0/index.html}{Version 19} of the LSST Science Pipelines. 
DP0.1 makes the DESC’s DC2 images and catalogs available to users through an early version the Rubin Science Platform (RSP) running at the US DAC. 

For full details on DP0.1 including an exact description of the data products served, see the documentation at \url{https://dp0-1.lsst.io/}

\subsubsection{Data Preview 0.2}
\label{sec:dp02}

Data Preview 0.2 (DP0.2) was released to approximately 600 early adopters from the community in June 2022, exactly 1 year after DP0.1. 
The dataset used for DP0.2 was the same as that used for DP0.1.
Rubin processed the simulated DC2 images with \href{https://pipelines.lsst.io/v/v23_0_0/index.html}{Version 23} of the LSST Science Pipelines. 
DP0.2 makes the Rubin reprocessed DESC DC2 images and catalogs available to users through an early version the Rubin Science Platform (RSP) running at the US DAC. 

For full details on DP0.2 including an exact description of the data products served, see the documentation at \url{https://dp0-2.lsst.io/}

\subsubsection{Data Preview 0.3}
\label{sec:dp03}

Delivered in June  2023, DP0.3 is the last in the DP0 series of Data Previews based on simulated LSST-like data. 
DP0.3 supports the Solar System Science Collaboration by hosting their simulated 1-year and 10-year Prompt Products Database )(PPDB) catalog to enable moving object analysis development  in  RSP at the US DAC. 

For full details on DP0.3 including an exact description of the data products served, see the documentation at \url{https://dp0-3.lsst.io/}

\subsection{Data Preview 1}
\label{sec:dp1}

Data Preview 1 (DP1) will serve data products generated from a subset of science-grade astronomically-useful images as soon as 
possible following the end of either ComCam on sky or System First Light (\S~\ref{ssec:commissioning-milestones}) to enable the community to prepare to work with LSST data. 
In the current schedule, which re-implements on-sky data-taking with ComCam for 2 months,  DP1 would be based on 2 months of ComCam data. 
Note that the time period during which data for DP1 are collected is \textit{very short}: the data products released in DP1 will be generated from relatively few observations taken by the end of ComCam work on sky or around System First Light.

In both DP1 scenarios, the exact processing pipelines and data products are still under discussion.
At minimum,  DP1  will deliver visit-level images and catalogs to enable initial studies of observational and instrumental effects. 
Table~\ref{tab:data-preview-summary} presents a current best idea of  the data products that might comprise DP1. 

A final decision on the dataset on which DP1 will be based will be taken in February 2024 following the Project's confirming decision about ComCam on-sky data-taking (\S~\ref{ssec:commissioning-schedule})

\subsection{Data Preview 2}
\label{sec:dp2}

Data Preview 2 will serve a full consistent reprocessing of all data collected as part of the LSSTCam Science Validation Surveys (SV Surveys) together with any other science-grade 
commissioning images taken throughout the Science Optimization phase of commissioning, including the DP1 data. 

Table~\ref{tab:data-preview-summary} presents a summary of the data products expected in DP1.

\subsection{Data Release 1}
\label{sec:dr1}

LSST Data Release 1 will be based on the first six months of data taken as part of the 10-year survey. 
Data Release Processing of this dataset is estimated to take six months, making the expected delivery date 1 year following the start of the 10 year survey. 
DR1 will be the first Data Release in which all data products will be provided. 

During routine LSST operations, prompt image data products will be made available 80 hours following camera readout.
They include raw images, processed single visit images (PVIs), difference images, and template images.
Access to unvetted PVIs and difference images in the first 6 months of the LSST is still to be decided.
Table~\ref{tab:data-preview-summary} presents a summary of the data products expected in DR1.
