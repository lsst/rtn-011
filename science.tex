\section{Science Drivers} \label{sec:science}

It will not be possible to generate templates for the whole sky in all filters by the end of the commissioning period. 
A strategy for template generation in the early phases of the survey, which require balancing a tradeoff between various factors such as smaller area with multiple filters vs a single filter over a large area, must be devised. 
Different science drivers naturally lead to different prioritization strategies, e.g. milky way science would prefer from templates that cover the galactic plane, time domain science would prefer templates in multiple bands rather than for a larger area. 
Supernova, transient and variable science strongly advocate for templates for all bands in the Deep Drilling Fields to be prioritized. 

Rubin Operations will work closely with the science community to develop a science-driven approach to template generation in commissioning and the early phases of the survey that will benefit the maximum number of science cases. 

\subsection{Time Domain}

The \tvssc reviewed the opportunities for \es for non time-critical and time-critical science cases in \citep{Hambleton_2020} and \citep{Street_2020} respectively. 
In both cases, they recommend the prioritization of template acquisition in multiple bands as the preferred strategy rather than single band  coverage over a larger area of sky. 

\subsection{Solar System}

The \sssc reviewed opportunities for \es in \citep{2020arXiv201005926L} for several high impact solar system science opportunities that would be enabled by accelerated template generation and alert production in year 1. 
They find that template generation options that maximize the sky coverage in year 1 where LSST Solar System Processing can run daily are strongly preferred, even if the templates result in noisier image subtraction compared to later years.

\subsection{Static Science}
 
Datasets for static science will flow from the \svs carried out during commissioning and released as Data Preview 2 (DP2). 
The commissioning team are planning to acquire on-sky observations that would enable science validation studies for the four LSST science drivers.
Guidance is being sought from the community to enhance opportunities for science validation and early science  based on commissioning data.

\subsection{Target of Opportunity}

Rubin Observatory will be prepared to take advantage of Targets of Opportunties (ToO) in the first year of operations (and hopefully SIT-COM).
