\textbf{PP Processed Visit Images}     & Commissioning of the PP image differencing and incremental template building will begin shortly after System First Light. Prompt image release is embargoed during commissioning.  &   Access to unvetted processed visit images as prompt products in the first 6 months of the LSST is still TBD. PP PVIs available after DP2.     \\  \arrayrulecolor{gray}\hline
\textbf{PP Difference Images}     & Difference imaging will be somewhat limited, since the image template sky coverage will be sparse. Prompt image release is embargoed during commissioning.  &     Difference imaging will steadily increase as incremental template building increases the templates available. Prompt access to unvetted PP difference images is still TBD. PP diff images available after DP2.    \\\hline

Prompt access to unvetted PP difference images is still TBD. PP diff images available after DP2. \\  \hline
\textbf{PP SSP Catalogs}   &   Measurements of known SSObjects sent to the MPC whenever difference images are available. Searches for new SSObjects performed if appropriately-cadenced data is present. SSP Catalogs likely unavailable for query in the PPDB. &   Standard SSP Daily Data Products produced from difference images as they are available and reported to the MPC. SSP catalogs available for query in the PPDB.  \\  \hline
