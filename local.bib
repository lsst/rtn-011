	title = {Year 1 of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time ({LSST}): Recommendations for Template Production to Enable Solar System Small Body Transient and Time Domain Science},
	abstract = {The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will discover âˆ¼6 million solar system planetesimals, providing in total over a billion photometric and astrometric measurements in 6 broad-band filters. Rubin Observatory's automated data reduction pipelines will employ difference imaging; templates representing the static sky will be subtracted from the nightly LSST observations in order to identify transient sources, including solar system moving objects. These templates are expected to be generated by coadding high quality images of the same pointing from the previous year's survey observations. The first year of LSST operations will require a different method for generating templates, if solar system discoveries are to be reported daily like Year 2 and beyond. We make recommendations for template production in the LSST's first year and present the opportunities for solar system small body transient and time domain science enhanced by this change.}
