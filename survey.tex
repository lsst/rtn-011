\section{Survey Cadence}

The early science observations can be separated into two kinds: commissioning observations, and early survey observations taken during the first 12 months of the LSST.

Optimizing the LSST Year 1 observing schedule to maximize early science may mean that the time sampling in the LSST survey region looks somewhat different to that in subsequent years.
One of the tasks of the Rubin Survey Cadence Optimization Committee (SCOC) is to make specific recommendations for these early survey observations, in terms of the prioritization of sky coverage and other specific choices needed for Year 1.
Producing a meaningful and informed recommendation that can be implemented effectively will require the SCOC to interact closely with the Rubin Commissioning and Operations teams, and so to allow time for those interactions, the Early Science recommendations will be deferred until 2023.
